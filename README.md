Gradescope Autograder Examples
==============================

This repository contains two sample autograders for Gradescope (one for Python and another for C)

In each directory, run the `gen_gradescope_zip.sh` script (inside the `autograder` directory) to generate the Autograder ZIP file that can be uploaded to Gradescope.

See the `README` files inside the `c` and `python` directories for more information about each example.
